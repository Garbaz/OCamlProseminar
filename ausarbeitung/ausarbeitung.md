# Principles of Asynchronous Execution

## Ocaml

## Rust

## Haskell

————————————————————————————————

## Bare Threads

## Event Driven

## Monadic

As done in OCaml and Haskell, one possible way to approach to asynchronous execution is via monads.

((Define monads / Explain their use for async / Describe their limitations and advantages))

## Notes

- Using User level threads vs. OS threads
- True parallelization (as in Rust(?)) vs. Just avoiding dead-time (as in Ocaml)
- Joining on multiples async tasks is only necessary when we actually have true parallelization
- Organize by language or by style?
